               <!-- Basic description of skiing-->
               <p> As wikipedia says: Skiing involves the use of skis to glide on snow for basic transport, a recreational activity, or competitive winter sport. As someone who has skiied since the small age of 7, it is the most fun in competitions!  </p>

               <!-- Basic overview of colour coding-->
               <p> The colour coding system in skiing differentiates the beginner, intermediate and expert slopes!</p>
               <!-- Small drop down note of colour system differences-->
               <details>
                  <summary> Please Note..</summary>
                  This is the colour system for the european ski slopes. However, countries like North America and Japan will have a completely different system.
               </details>
               <!-- Unordered list of slope colours and description-->
               <ul>
                  <li>Green: At an angle of between 0-20% this is perfect for beginners!</li>
                  <li>Blue: This slope between 20-30% is great for beginners who have had a bit of practice, and want to gain a little more speed</li>
                  <li>Red: A red slope should only be tried once you have had much practice and ideally with an experienced skiier. The angle at 30-45% can be a bit of a shock the first time you try! However, it can be great fun if you get used to it!</li>
                  <li>Black: A black slope is incredibly steep and can result in serious injury if tried with little practice. Therefore, it is essential to train yourself to handle the 45% angle, ideally with the use of the red slopes!</li>
